Privacy Policy
AI Waiting Companion - Privacy Policy

Effective Date: September 30, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how the "AI Waiting Companion" Chrome extension (the "Extension") collects, uses, and handles information. We are committed to protecting user privacy and have designed the Extension to be anonymous by default.

1. Summary

We prioritize your privacy. We do not collect any Personally Identifiable Information (PII). We do not track who you are or where you browse.

2. Information We Collect

The Extension collects only the minimum information necessary to provide its service. When you open the Extension popup, we collect:

Anonymous Timestamp: We record the exact time the Extension popup was opened (e.g., "2025-09-30 05:30:00").

3. Information We DO NOT Collect

We explicitly state that we do NOT collect:

Usernames, email addresses, or account information.

IP Addresses (Note: While the underlying server infrastructure may temporarily log IP addresses for security and abuse prevention, we do not store or associate them with usage timestamps).

Browsing history or the content of the websites you visit.

Device identifiers or location data.

4. How We Use the Information

The collected timestamps are used solely for the following purpose:

Aggregated Statistics: We process these timestamps to calculate the total number of times the extension popup has been opened globally within the last hour, day, week, month, and year. These aggregated statistics are then displayed within the extension to all users to provide a sense of shared experience.

We do not use this data for profiling, advertising, or any other commercial purpose.

5. Data Storage and Third-Party Services

We use a third-party service, Supabase (Supabase, Inc.), to host our backend database and API.

Security: Communication between the Extension and Supabase is encrypted via HTTPS. We rely on Supabase's infrastructure to secure the data against unauthorized access.

Data Sharing: We do not share, sell, rent, or trade the collected timestamps with any third parties, except as necessary to provide the Service (i.e., storage via Supabase).

6. Data Retention

Timestamps are automatically and permanently deleted from our database when they are older than one (1) year.

7. Children's Privacy

The Extension is not directed to individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13.

8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" at the top.
